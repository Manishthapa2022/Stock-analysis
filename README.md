# **Stock-analysis**
## Overview of the Project
The main purpose o the project is to provide Steve the Total daily Volume and the Yearly return for a portfolio of stocks so that he can advise his parents to invest accordingly for better returns. The analysis was carried out both using a original and a refactored code. The refactored code was used specifically so that Steve could add more data sets to it which he could not to the original code. 
## Results:
The following table illustrates for the portfolio of stocks for both 2017 and 2018.

- The total run time for refactored code for 2017 was 0.0234375 secs and for 2018 was 0.00234375 secs.

## Summary:
### Advantages and Disadvantages of using the Refactored code
The advantages of using the refactored code are that it can be used on a much larger data set and the time taken for the execution of the code is relatively smaller, whereas on the other hand lot of information needs to added including additional arrays and variables because of the larger data sets that eventually can corrupt the previous code.
