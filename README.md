# **Stock-analysis**
## Overview of the Project
The main purpose o the project is to provide Steve the Total daily Volume and the Yearly return for a portfolio of stocks so that he can advise his parents to invest accordingly for better returns. The analysis was carried out both using a original and a refactored code. The refactored code was used specifically so that Steve could add more data sets to it which he could not to the original code. 
## Results:
The following images illustrates for the portfolio of stocks using Original and Refactored code for the year 2018.

Based on the above, the following observations were made
- ENPH at 81.9% and RUN a 84% were the only two stocks which had the positive returns whereas JKS at 60.5% and DQ at 62.6% had the lowest return for 2018.
- The total run time for refactored code for 2018 was 0.0390625 secs and was 0.3242188 secs for the original code.

## Summary:
### Advantages and Disadvantages of using the Refactored code
The advantages of using the refactored code are that it can be used on a much larger data set and the time taken for the execution of the code is relatively smaller, whereas on the other hand lot of information needs to be added including additional arrays and variables because of the larger data sets that eventually can corrupt the previous code.   
### Advantages and Disadvantages of the Original and Refactored code
The Original code was much simplier and we could easil obtain the Summations of Daily volumes and Retunrs using the current Data Set provided by Steve, whereas the run time was much more at 0.3242188 secs for 2018. Also, we could not carry out much detailed analysis as only Tickers were used as ann array whereas with refactored code, Ticker volumes, Tickerstarting prices and TickerEnding prices were also used. 
The advantages of using the refactored code are that the run time was much smaller at 0.0390625 secs (2018 data), and also Steve can add thousands of Data sets which would not be possible with the original code. Although it can be very time consuming espcially when the code is long and complicated. Good coding knowledge and understanding of the data is crucial as modifying the original code can corrupt it.
